QRCodes are two dimensional bar codes very popular in Japan.  This app is a QR Code reader which uses the iPhone camera.

Currently, the app works with codes from semapedia and my own generated codes.  I'm having some bugs in certain conditions which I think center around retries. (for a 3-Q code, it tries 3-Q first, then 3-H repeatedly which is wrong).

Also, it doesn't actually decode the data yet to figure out if it's a URL.  That'll be easy. :)
